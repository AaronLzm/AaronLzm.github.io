Priors represent the initial beliefs about the model parameters before observing data, and a poorly chosen prior can lead to inaccurate conclusions. In the context of Bayesian deep learning, this problem is magnified due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space in neural networks. The common practice of using so-called "uninformative" or vague priors, such as standard Gaussian distributions, is often a pragmatic choice due to the difficulty of specifying meaningful priors for millions of parameters. However, research has shown that such seemingly innocuous choices can introduce unintended biases and negatively affect the model's performance.`,-1),e("p",null,"A misspecified prior can undermine the very advantages that make Bayesian methods attractive, such as reliable uncertainty quantification and model selection. Studies have demonstrated that the choice of prior has a substantial impact on a model's true and false positive rates. Furthermore, there is no universally optimal prior; the best choice is often dependent on the specific dataset being analyzed.",-1),e("p",null,"This challenge is not merely a theoretical concern. The difficulty in defining appropriate priors has practical consequences, hindering the widespread adoption of Bayesian methods in complex, high-stakes applications. The process of mapping subjective prior beliefs into a tractable probability distribution is non-trivial and can be a significant hurdle for practitioners.",-1),e("p",null,"While the challenge of prior selection is a major restraint, it is important to acknowledge that it is one of two primary obstacles, the other being computational complexity. Bayesian methods, especially for deep learning models, are notoriously computationally expensive. Techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for sampling from the posterior distribution can be prohibitively slow for large models. While more scalable methods like variational inference have been developed, they introduce approximations that can affect the quality of the results.",-1),e("p",null,"These two challenges—prior specification and computational cost—are often intertwined. More sophisticated and potentially more appropriate priors can further complicate the already difficult task of posterior inference, increasing the computational burden. Therefore, it is more accurate to view the advancement of Bayesian machine learning as being constrained by the dual challenges of both defining meaningful priors and performing inference in a computationally tractable manner.",-1),e("p",null,"In conclusion, while computational cost remains a significant barrier, the problem of undetermined prior settings is a fundamental and pressing issue that restrains the full potential of Bayesian machine learning. The active area of research into developing more robust methods for prior specification, including learning priors from data and creating more flexible prior distributions, underscores the criticality of this challenge.
