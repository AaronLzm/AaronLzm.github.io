Observational Studies vs. Randomized Experiments</strong></span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>Observational studies</strong>: Investigators observe and record data without intervening (e.g., studying if looking up causes others to look up). Criticisms include confounding (e.g., both pedestrians look up due to external factors like noise, not causation).</li><li><strong>Randomized experiments</strong>: Assign treatment randomly, ensuring exchangeability by design. Preferred for causal inference but often impractical (e.g., time-consuming, unethical, or unfeasible).</li><li><strong>Key limitation of observational studies</strong>: Associations may not imply causation due to unmeasured confounders. However, much scientific knowledge (e.g., evolution, global warming) derives from observational data.</li></ul><h4 id="_2-identifiability-conditions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-identifiability-conditions"><span><strong>2.
