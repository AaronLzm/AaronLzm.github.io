### Chapter 21: G-METHODS FOR TIME-VARYING TREATMENTS  
**Context**: This chapter addresses limitations of traditional methods for time-varying treatments with treatment-confounder feedback (e.g., bias under null effects). It introduces three g-methods—g-formula, IP weighting, and g-estimation—that correctly estimate causal effects under sequential exchangeability, positivity, and consistency.

#### 21.1 The g-formula for time-varying treatments  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Core Theory**: The g-formula standardizes mean outcomes to the confounder distribution in the study population. For time-varying treatments, it generalizes to:  
  $$ \sum_{\bar{l}} E[Y | \bar{A} = \bar{a}, \bar{L} = \bar{l}] \prod_{k=0}^K f(l_k | \bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_{k-1}) $$  
  where $\bar{a}$ is the treatment strategy, $\bar{l}$ is confounder history, and $f(l_k | \bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_{k-1})$ is the confounder density at time $k$ given prior history.  
- **Key Formula**: Under sequential exchangeability, this equals $E[Y^{\bar{a}}]$, the counterfactual mean under strategy $\bar{a}$.  
- **Positivity Requirement**: The g-formula requires $f(l_k | \bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_{k-1}) > 0$ for all $\bar{a}, \bar{l}$ (Technical Point 19.2).  
- **Application**: In Table 21.1 (sequentially randomized experiment), the g-formula correctly estimates $E[Y^{a_0=1,a_1=1}] - E[Y^{a_0=0,a_1=0}] = 0$ (null effect).  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Confounder Dependency**: Omitting necessary confounders (e.g., $L_1$ in Figure 20.8) invalidates the g-formula’s causal interpretation.  
- **Component Interpretation**: Individual components (e.g., $E[Y|\bar{A},\bar{L}]$) may lack causal meaning, but their combination identifies $E[Y^{\bar{a}}]$ under sequential exchangeability.  
- **Simulation View**: The g-formula simulates counterfactual outcomes by assigning treatment $\bar{a}$ and preserving observed covariate distributions (Figures 21.1–21.2).

#### 21.2 IP weighting for time-varying treatments  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Weights Definition**:  
  - Nonstabilized: $W^{\bar{A}} = \prod_{k=0}^K \frac{1}{f(A_k | \bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k)}$  
  - Stabilized: $SW^{\bar{A}} = \prod_{k=0}^K \frac{f(A_k | \bar{A}_{k-1})}{f(A_k | \bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k)}$  
- **Estimation**: $E[Y^{\bar{a}}]$ is the mean of $Y$ in the pseudo-population weighted by $W^{\bar{A}}$ or $SW^{\bar{A}}$, among those with $\bar{A} = \bar{a}$.  
- **Marginal Structural Models (MSMs)**: For high-dimensional treatments, specify $E[Y^{\bar{a}}] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{cum}(\bar{a})$. Parameters are estimated via weighted least squares.  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Equivalence to g-formula**: Nonparametric IP weighting and g-formula yield identical results, even without causal validity.  
- **Model Robustness**: MSMs avoid the g-null paradox (Technical Point 21.3) and allow effect modification by baseline variables (e.g., $E[Y^{\bar{a}} | V] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{cum}(\bar{a}) + \beta_2 V + \beta_3 \text{cum}(\bar{a})V$).  
- **Software**: Implemented in R (`gfoRmula`) and SAS (`GFORMULA`).

#### 21.3 A doubly robust estimator for time-varying treatments  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Doubly Robust Estimator**: Combines treatment and outcome models. Consistent if either model is correct.  
- **Steps for "Always Treat" ($\bar{a} = 1$)**:
  1. Fit treatment model $\pi_k(\bar{L}_k; \alpha)$ for $\Pr(A_k = 1 | \bar{A}_{k-1} = 1, \bar{L}_k)$.  
  2. Compute time-varying IP weights $\widehat{W}^{1_m}$.  
  3. Fit sequential outcome models $b_m(\bar{L}_m; \beta_m)$ with $\widehat{W}^{1_m}$ as covariate, starting from $t = K$ to $t = 0$.  
  4. Estimate $E[Y^{\bar{a}=1}]$ as the sample mean of $b_0(\bar{L}_0; \hat{\beta})$.  
- **Robustness**: $K+2$-robust—unbiased if treatment models for times $0$ to $m$ and outcome models for $m+1$ to $K$ are correct for any $m$.  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Extensions**: Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimators (TMLE) handle dynamic strategies (Technical Point 21.6).  
- **Practical Use**: Requires correct specification of either treatment or outcome models, reducing bias in observational studies.

#### 21.4 G-estimation for time-varying treatments  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Structural Nested Mean Model (SNMM)**: Models the effect of a "blip" of treatment at time $k$:  
  $$ E[Y^{a_{k-1}, a_k, 0_{k+1}} - Y^{a_{k-1}, 0_k} | \bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_k] = a_k \gamma_k(\bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_k; \beta) $$  
- **G-estimation**:  
  1. Compute $H_k(\psi^\dagger) = Y - \sum_{j=k}^K A_j \gamma_j(\bar{A}_{j-1}, L_j; \psi^\dagger)$.  
  2. Solve estimating equations for $\psi^\dagger$ such that $H_k(\psi^\dagger)$ is independent of $A_k$ given past history.  
- **Closed-Form Solution**: For linear SNMMs, $\hat{\beta}$ has an analytic expression (Technical Point 21.8).  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Rank Preservation**: Optional assumption; g-estimation remains valid for SNMMs without it.  
- **Efficiency vs. Robustness**: SNMMs increase efficiency if no effect modification by past covariates, but may introduce bias if misspecified (vs. MSMs).

#### 21.5 Censoring is a time-varying treatment  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Censoring Weights**: Extend IP weighting to handle censoring $C_k$:  
  $$ W^{\bar{C}} = \prod_{k=1}^{K+1} \frac{1}{\Pr(C_k = 0 | \bar{C}_{k-1} = 0, \bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_{k-1})} $$  
- **G-formula Adjustment**: For censored data, condition on $\bar{C} = 0$:  
  $$ \sum_{\bar{l}} E[Y | \bar{C} = 0, \bar{A} = \bar{a}, \bar{L} = \bar{l}] \prod_{k=0}^K f(l_k | c_k = 0, \bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_{k-1}) $$  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Survival Analysis**: For failure-time outcomes, use pooled logistic models with IP weights or g-formula (Technical Point 21.10).  
- **Selection Bias**: Censoring can induce bias if not adjusted (e.g., when $C$ is a collider).

#### 21.6 The big g-formula  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Definition**: The big g-formula includes all variables (observed $L$ and unobserved $U$) and identifies $E[Y^g]$ under any causal DAG.  
- **Reduction to Observed Data**: If d-separation holds, it simplifies to formulas using only observed data (e.g., front-door criterion).  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Front-Door Formula Proof**: Under Figure 7.14, $E[Y^a] = \sum_m \Pr(m | a) \sum_{a'} E[Y | m, a'] \Pr(a')$ (Technical Point 21.11).  
- **SWIG Property**: Single-world counterfactual graphs (SWIGs) enable d-separation proofs without cross-world assumptions (Technical Point 21.12).
