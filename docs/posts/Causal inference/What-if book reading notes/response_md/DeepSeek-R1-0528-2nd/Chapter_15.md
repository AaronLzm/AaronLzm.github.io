### Chapter 15: OUTCOME REGRESSION AND PROPENSITY SCORES  

**Introduction**  
Outcome regression and propensity score methods are widely used parametric approaches for causal inference but are limited to simpler settings. They are unsuitable for time-varying treatments, which require g-methods (IP weighting, standardization, g-estimation). This chapter focuses on conventional methods applicable only to non-longitudinal data.

### 15.1 Outcome Regression  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Core Theory**: Estimates causal effects by modeling the outcome conditional on treatment \(A\) and covariates \(L\). The structural model is:  
  \(E[Y^{a,c=0}|L] = \beta_0 + \beta_1a + \beta_2aL + \beta_3L\), where:  
  - \(\beta_1, \beta_2\): Parameters for causal effects of \(A\) on \(Y\) within strata of \(L\).  
  - \(\beta_0, \beta_3\): Nuisance parameters quantifying the baseline mean \(E[Y^{a=0,c=0}|L]\).  
- **Key Formula**: Under exchangeability, positivity, and no censoring, parameters are estimable via OLS regression:  
  \(E[Y|A, C=0, L] = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1A + \alpha_2AL + \alpha_3L\).  
- **Important Concepts**:  
  - **Nuisance Parameters**: \(\beta_0, \beta_3\) lack causal interpretation and must be correctly specified to avoid bias.  
  - **Effect Modification**: Product terms (\(aL\)) capture effect heterogeneity by \(L\).  
- **Application Scenarios**:  
  - Estimating conditional causal effects within covariate strata.  
  - Suitable for continuous or discrete outcomes (e.g., logistic regression for binary \(Y\)).  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Misspecification Bias**: Incorrect modeling of \(L-Y\) relationship (e.g., omitting quadratic terms) biases estimates.  
- **G-Estimation Comparison**: Unlike structural nested models, outcome regression requires correct specification of the \(L-Y\) association but not the treatment model.  
- **Example**: For smoking cessation (\(A\)) and weight gain (\(Y\)), effect estimates varied by smoking intensity (2.8 kg for 5 cigarettes/day vs. 4.4 kg for 40 cigarettes/day).

### 15.2 Propensity Scores  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Core Theory**: Propensity score \(\pi(L) = \Pr[A=1|L]\) balances covariates \(L\) between treated (\(A=1\)) and untreated (\(A=0\)) groups.  
- **Key Properties**:  
  - **Balancing Score**: \(A \perp\!\!\!\perp L \mid \pi(L)\) (covariate distributions equalize within \(\pi(L)\) strata).  
  - **Sufficiency**: Adjusting for \(\pi(L)\) suffices if \(L\) ensures exchangeability.  
- **Important Concepts**:  
  - **Estimation**: \(\pi(L)\) is estimated via logistic regression of \(A\) on \(L\).  
  - **Positivity**: Requires \(0 < \pi(L) < 1\) for all \(L\).  
- **Application Scenarios**:  
  - Replace high-dimensional \(L\) with scalar \(\pi(L)\) for stratification, standardization, or matching.  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Randomized Trials**: \(\pi(L) = 0.5\) for all subjects, ensuring perfect balance.  
- **Overlap**: Distributions of \(\pi(L)\) must overlap between treated/untreated (Figure 15.1 shows overlap in smoking cessation study).  
- **Limitation**: Only balances *measured* covariates; residual confounding possible.

### 15.3 Propensity Stratification and Standardization  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Stratification**:  
  - Divide subjects into strata (e.g., deciles) of estimated \(\pi(L)\).  
  - Estimate causal effect within each stratum: \(E[Y|A=1, C=0, \pi(L)=s] - E[Y|A=0, C=0, \pi(L)=s]\).  
- **Standardization**:  
  - Fit outcome model \(E[Y|A, C=0, \pi(L)]\), then standardize over \(\pi(L)\) distribution.  
  - Formula: \(\sum_s \left( E[Y|A=1, C=0, \pi(L)=s] - E[Y|A=0, C=0, \pi(L)=s] \right) \Pr[\pi(L)=s]\).  
- **Key Requirement**: Correct specification of outcome model (e.g., linearity or splines for \(\pi(L)\)).  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Effect Modification**: Including \(A \times \pi(L)\) interaction terms captures effect heterogeneity.  
- **Bias-Variance Trade-off**:  
  - Decile-based stratification may violate exchangeability if \(\pi(L)\) distributions differ within strata.  
  - Continuous \(\pi(L)\) modeling reduces bias but requires functional form correctness.  
- **Example**: Standardized effect of smoking cessation was 3.6 kg (95% CI: 2.7, 4.6).

### 15.4 Propensity Matching  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Method**: Match treated subjects with untreated subjects having similar \(\pi(L)\) values (e.g., \(\pm 0.05\)).  
- **Target Population**: The matched population (e.g., effect in the treated if untreated are matched to treated).  
- **Consistency**: Under exchangeability and positivity, associational measures in the matched population estimate causal effects.  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Closeness Criteria**:  
  - Too loose → Poor balance → Bias.  
  - Too tight → High exclusion → Wide confidence intervals.  
- **Positivity Handling**: Excludes subjects without matches (e.g., 2 treated with high \(\pi(L)\) in smoking study).  
- **Transportability Issue**: Matched populations are ill-characterized (e.g., defined by \(\pi(L)\) values, not real-world variables).

### 15.5 Propensity Models, Structural Models, Predictive Models  
**Technical Points**:  
- **Propensity Models**:  
  - Model \(\Pr[A=1|L]\); parameters are nuisances (non-causal).  
  - Goal: Ensure exchangeability, not prediction accuracy.  
- **Structural Models**:  
  - Describe causal links (e.g., marginal structural models, structural nested models).  
  - Parameters have causal interpretation (e.g., treatment effects).  
- **Predictive Models**:  
  - Forecast outcomes using associations (no causal interpretation).  

**Fine Points**:  
- **Variable Selection Pitfalls**:  
  - Including instruments or colliders in propensity models amplifies bias.  
  - Predictive algorithms (e.g., stepwise selection) harm causal inference.  
- **Example**: Adding "hospital" (unnecessary covariate) to propensity models inflates variance without reducing bias.  
- **Key Insight**: Causal methods require correct functional form (e.g., splines) and exchangeability/positivity.  

---  
**Logical Flow**:  
- Sections 15.1–15.4 detail methods leveraging covariates (\(L\)) or propensity scores (\(\pi(L)\)) for conditional exchangeability.  
- Section 15.5 contrasts these with predictive modeling, emphasizing causal inference prerequisites.  
- The chapter underscores limitations of conventional methods for complex (e.g., time-varying) treatments, setting up Part III's focus on g-methods.
