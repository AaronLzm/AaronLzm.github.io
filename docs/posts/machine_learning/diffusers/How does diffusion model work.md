Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have gained popularity for their ability to produce high-quality samples across various domains, such as images, audio, and text. They work by modeling the process of gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process to generate new samples. Here's a breakdown of how diffusion models work:
### 1. **Forward Process (Diffusion):**
The forward process involves gradually adding noise to the data over a series of time steps. This process can be described as a Markov chain where each step adds a small amount of Gaussian noise to the data. The goal is to transform the data into a simple distribution, typically Gaussian noise, over a fixed number of steps.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
- Start with data \( x_0 \).
- At each time step \( t \), add noise to get \( x_t \) using:
\[
x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t} \epsilon
\]
- Here, \( \alpha_t \) is a variance schedule, and \( \epsilon \) is Gaussian noise.
### 2. **Reverse Process (Denoising):**
The reverse process aims to learn how to denoise the data, effectively reversing the diffusion process to generate new samples from noise.
- **Training Objective:**
- The model learns to predict the noise \( \epsilon \) that was added at each step, given the noisy data \( x_t \) and the time step \( t \).
- The objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted noise and the actual noise added during the forward process.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
- The model predicts \( \epsilon \) using a neural network \( \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \).
- The loss function is typically the mean squared error between the predicted and true noise:
\[
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon} \left[ \|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2 \right]
\]
### 3. **Sampling:**
To generate new samples, the model starts with pure Gaussian noise and iteratively applies the learned reverse process to denoise it, step by step, until it reaches a sample in the data space.
- **Iterative Denoising:**
- Start with \( x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \).
- For each step \( t \) from \( T \) to 1, use the model to predict the noise and update \( x_{t-1} \) using:
\[
x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{1-\alpha_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \right) + \sigma_t z
\]
- Here, \( \bar{\alpha}_t \) is the cumulative product of \( \alpha \) values, and \( \sigma_t \) is a small noise term to ensure stability.
### Advantages:
- **Flexibility:** Can model complex distributions and generate high-quality samples.
- **Stability:** The gradual nature of the diffusion process helps in stabilizing training.
### Applications:
- Image generation
- Text-to-image synthesis
- Audio synthesis
- Video generation
Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating realistic and diverse samples, making them a powerful tool in the field of generative modeling.
